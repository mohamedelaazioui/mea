# Enterprise Test Architecture

## Objective
Scalable QA architecture with governance, automation, and CI/CD integration for mission-critical platforms.

## Architecture Layers
- Governance & Compliance
- Automation (UI/API/Data/Infra)
- DevSecOps Integration
- Observability & Metrics

## Impact
- Regression reduction: 70%
- Release predictability: +60%
- Operational risk reduction: 50%

# DevSecOps Quality Platform

## Continuous Quality Pipeline
Code → Build → Static Security Scan → Automated Tests → Performance → Release Gate → Production

## Controls
- Risk-based automation
- CI/CD quality gates
- SAST & DAST integration
- Observability

## Outcome
Secure, predictable releases with minimal operational risk.

# Banking Quality Engineering

## Focus
High-volume financial systems QA

## Domains
- Transaction integrity
- Regulatory compliance
- Performance
- Secure payments
- Data reconciliation

## Impact
- Reduced production incidents
- Faster release cycles
- Audit & compliance readiness

# SCADA Assurance Framework

## Objective
Industrial system QA framework for operational continuity and security.

## Testing
- Alarm & failover validation
- Cybersecurity verification
- Monitoring integrity
- Operational continuity

## Outcome
Reduced operational and safety risks.

# AI-Driven Quality Engineering

## Vision
Autonomous, predictive, intelligent QA systems

## Features
- AI test generation
